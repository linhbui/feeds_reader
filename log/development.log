Sure, he tells me, \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E took some liberties by having a wormhole materialize near Saturn, but he, like Tyson, still enjoyed the film, and appreciated that it made these complex theories accessible to the 99% of the population who don\\u0026#8217;t study quantum field theory.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis appreciation for the science of \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E makes it hard for me to understand why others have condemned the film\\u0026#8217;s science as if it sullied their family honor. What are they so afraid of? That \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u0026#8216;s pseudoscience will fraudulently inspire young men and women to become astrophysicists?

He took us up to the observatory in the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy (made possible by a donation from a certain wealthy Hopkins alum) and my classmates and I took turns looking at Saturn and other celestial objects through an enormous telescope. It was a moving experience—there I was, looking at a ball of gas hundreds of millions of miles away, in tremendous detail. Not a picture, not an illustration, but the actual planet itself.

It was very obvious that a lot of thought had gone into the science, especially General Relativity. It was clear that the writers used what we know about the physics of the Universe as boundaries (or at least speed bumps) for where and how the plot could evolve. The movie definitely offers teachable moments which I plan to use next year in class.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInteresting.

We emailed Uber for comment and will update this piece if we get any. \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003ETony is 49 years old. He is an UberSUV driver in New York City. Raised in Brooklyn, Tony has been working as a driver since 1986—first at a private-luxury car company and now at Uber. Edited excerpts of what he told Quartz: \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 2012, I lost my car to Hurricane Sandy, and I had to rent out a car to drive around. Then somebody told me that a company called Uber was giving $1,000 to start driving for them, and then a certain percent for each ride. It was 25% for a sedan, and 28% for an SUV. So I went and started working for Uber.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBasically, there’s no \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.driveubernyc.com/tlc-process\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehiring process\\u003C/a\\u003E or anything like that. You just go there, and they give you a class in which they tell you something about Uber, and basic stuff about what to do with the customer, how long to wait, and everything I at least knew as a driver because I went there with experience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/10/08/uber-skimps-on-driver-training-then-charges-drivers-65-for-basic-driver-skills-course/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eno training\\u003C/a\\u003E. They basically hire people from the gutter. They don’t care. They just need bodies. They need somebody who can get their own cars, fit the best possible GPS, and start driving.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUber doesn’t have physical contracts. Everything is electronically done. But if you don’t sign on their terms and conditions, you cannot work. So we have to sign, though it’s actually not signing. They send a link, and you have to electronically enter and accept the terms. And these terms, even Uber guys who wrote them wouldn’t understand. That’s how long and complicated they are.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut it is like a little school. It has \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/08/14/what-are-we-actually-rating-when-we-rate-other-people/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ea rating system\\u003C/a\\u003E. Though we are not supposed to be rated, Uber is supposed to be rated, the reality is different. After every ride, customers can give up to five stars for their experience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEarlier as a driver, I could see the rating a customer gave me. For a few months now, Uber has scrapped the option, so I don\\u0026#8217;t know what I am being rated.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo, mentally, these rating systems affect us a lot. When you’re doing a good job as a reporter, you don’t want people telling you that you’re doing a bad job. If I am driving somebody who doesn’t live in New York, and they complain that I took the wrong route, how would they know the route that I should have taken? New York doesn’t have too many exits. In my 20 years of working with corporate employees, I haven\\u0026#8217;t had a single customer complaining that I took the wrong route. We have to live in the fear of losing our jobs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECompared to my friends, I don’t have much problem because I am a VIP driver, and I have a 4.8 average. I can still get fired though, if I go below a 4.6.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow as the company has grown so fast, our customers are more like yellow-cab trash. I have kids jumping up and down. Businesswomen putting their feet up. I never had that before. In corporate, there were only business people, where everybody behaved themselves. In Uber, I pick up drunk people at night, and they throw up. I have people who behave themselves badly, and I can’t say anything because of the rating.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EYou have people in Uber—starting from the top manager to the guy who washes the floors—they have the same brains because when you go to talk to them, it’s like talking to a bunch of dummies. I wonder which limousine university did they go to—because there is none.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMy friend who is a driver, he is afraid of his own shadow. He would never back-talk to a customer. But he got an email from Uber that there are a lot of complaints against him, though he doesn’t remember having even one. They called him to their office and charged him a $99 fee. Uber said the money was for advertising and commercials, but everyone knew it was to save their jobs. And they did that to many of my friends. This is how sinister they are.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd if you ask them, the staff doesn\\u0026#8217;t know how to answer your question because they are told from the top that the computer tells us this. Well, what did you get hired for? To make your own decisions or you want the computer to make it? The computer doesn’t know customer relations. The computer doesn\\u0026#8217;t know the routes. The computer only gives you statistics.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey say bad ratings don\\u0026#8217;t affect the drivers getting fares, but it does. Computers are programmed by people. If they say \\u0026#8220;we have a problem from this guy, but he is still a good driver, let’s give him less work and tell the computers to give them only, say, five pick-ups a day.\\u0026#8221; It is very calculated.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn Dec. 1, they are going to automatically put those below 4.6 in UberX—whether they like it or not. [Uber X is the lower cost Uber service where the base fare is $3 as compared with UberSUV, which is a luxury service with a base fare of $14; the per-minute cost in UberX is half as much as in UberSUV.] Some of my friends will have a problem because they are 4.6. One of them owns a very expensive vehicle, and his rating system is actually 4.2. He is afraid they will transfer him to UberX.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUber is afraid, in my opinion, that if they lose to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amny.com/transit/tlc-proposes-rules-changes-to-hiring-drivers-1.9512638\\\"\\u003Ethe TLC (New York City\\u0026#8217;s Taxi and Limousine Commission) in court\\u003C/a\\u003E, they are going to lose customers. The rule says a driver cannot work for more than one base at once. And drivers in Uber are right now working for two or three bases, though TLC is catching them and giving them $500 tickets.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat Uber did in the summers was give out iPhones to drivers, just like you give candies to kids, and also gave $500 to whoever joined. So, anybody with that phone and the app installed in the phone could work for Uber. They completely violated the TLC rule. They wanted all the business—they are like those pigs who want to eat everything.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey hired too many drivers, so now there is more supply than the demand.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf you go to any Uber office, it is like a zoo—people come from different countries, because they heard about Uber. “Oh, we can work in Uber in New York.” But they have never driven cars here. I have a friend who came from Pakistan a few months ago, got a TLC license, and now works for Uber. And he has no knowledge of the city; all he does is follow the GPS route. And it’s not just this one guy; there are many others.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese drivers come with no experience. Of course, customers are going to give bad ratings.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI am working exclusively for Uber. But they are diverting more customers to UberX—and that takes away my fare. They told me, “Go get a good vehicle.” And I have one. I now own a Lincoln Navigator.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey promised me heaven, but I haven’t gotten that. It’s only hell for now. I am actually waiting for the TLC rule. If it does happen that drivers cannot work for more than one base, Uber will go after the drivers and get their phones back. Then they are going to lose UberX drivers—and we are going to start doing okay.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen I started working with Uber, I was never free for more than five minutes. I was busy all day long. Sometimes, I just wanted to park my car and sleep. Now, I have too much time and I make less money. Well, the company has a lot of people who have downloaded the Uber app, but that doesn’t mean all of them are regularly booking cabs. So downloading the app is half reality of the statistic. I think a lot of people just try Uber once, and once they end up paying a lot of money, they don’t want to try Uber again.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOnly the payment is no problem. Every Thursday, you get your check. Only once they had a problem—and we all chimed in on the internet, and we gave them our piece of mind, so they fixed the system. That’s the only good thing, because I don’t know if they want to violate labor laws since there are going to be a lot of labor laws to violate.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EToday, we got an email that they will give us a discount for health insurance, with a company called Stride Health. But we can get better discounts without Uber. We can get it for $640; with Uber, it\\u0026#8217;s $680. So which is better? I can\\u0026#8217;t pick either because my wife doesn’t work, and I have two kids to support. I am the sole provider and I cannot pay $640 dollars.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHowever, with 10,000 drivers in group insurance, we should get a huge discount.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI bought the car in 2013. I still have car payments. When I bought this car, I wondered am I still going to be in Uber to pay this off? Because I don’t know how long am I going to be working for them; anyone can get fired with the current rating system. Even me, as a VIP driver, I am worried. There should at least be a 10-year assurance, and if not, then at least two years. And once you’re doing good, they should forget about the rating system. If Uber were the ones to be rated, they would get the lowest rating.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=299655\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/299655/why-your-uber-driver-hates-uber/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-11-20T06:00:45-08:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=299655\",\"dc_creator\":\"Shelly Walia\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap284410821273-e1416470098606.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Hello, Again\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap284410821273-e1416470098606.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/299655/why-your-uber-driver-hates-uber/"], ["published_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:00:45 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why your Uber driver hates Uber"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:21:36 UTC +00:00]]

The last attempt at comprehensive immigration reform failed in 2007; the most recent overhaul was accomplished in 1986.

The last attempt at comprehensive immigration reform failed in 2007; the most recent overhaul was accomplished in 1986.

Sure, he tells me, \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E took some liberties by having a wormhole materialize near Saturn, but he, like Tyson, still enjoyed the film, and appreciated that it made these complex theories accessible to the 99% of the population who don\\u0026#8217;t study quantum field theory.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis appreciation for the science of \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E makes it hard for me to understand why others have condemned the film\\u0026#8217;s science as if it sullied their family honor. What are they so afraid of? That \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u0026#8216;s pseudoscience will fraudulently inspire young men and women to become astrophysicists?

He took us up to the observatory in the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy (made possible by a donation from a certain wealthy Hopkins alum) and my classmates and I took turns looking at Saturn and other celestial objects through an enormous telescope. It was a moving experience—there I was, looking at a ball of gas hundreds of millions of miles away, in tremendous detail. Not a picture, not an illustration, but the actual planet itself. Not long after I took that class, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/riess-facts.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERiess was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics\\u003C/a\\u003E (along with a few others) for discovering that the expansion of the universe was accelerating.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EYou might now be wondering what Professor Riess thinks of \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E.

This was his response:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EI saw it opening day and in fact took my whole research group to see it. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the movie, including or maybe especially me. I recognized a lot of well thought out physics in the movie. It was very obvious that a lot of thought had gone into the science, especially General Relativity. It was clear that the writers used what we know about the physics of the Universe as boundaries (or at least speed bumps) for where and how the plot could evolve. The movie definitely offers teachable moments which I plan to use next year in class.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInteresting.

One \\u0026#8220;misdemeanour\\u0026#8221; mentioned was that he didn’t act against a code of conduct violation by a player (unnamed in the finding made public), but that apparently preceded his tenure as BCCI president and also did not pertain to the IPL.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EThe worst effected would be Srinivasan who wants to stand for BCCI president again and he clearly has the support within the establishment for this.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe League’s chief operating officer (COO) Sundar Raman, it is mentioned, made some calls to a person who was in touch with alleged bookies. Whether this was done out of ignorance or knowledge is unclear. Explanations by Srinivasan and Sundar were to be lodged with the Supreme Court by November 20.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EApparently, there are players mentioned too in the Mudgal report (though identified by numbers, not names) and they also have to wait the noose of judicial opinion.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile there has been quiet celebration in the BCCI after the Mudgal findings came into the public domain, what happens from here will depend on how Supreme Court justices Thakur and Kalifulla view the case. It is possible that they may take an adverse position, which could mean that the defendants will be hit for a six.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn that case, the worst effected would be Srinivasan who wants to stand for BCCI president again and he clearly has the support within the establishment for this. His name and fate—as indeed those of several others—hangs in the balance.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut whatever the Supreme Court final order, there are some steps which the establishment must pursue as an imperative to restore the faith of fans (and I dare say even financial supporters) in Indian cricket.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThe reforms\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe biggest complaint is about the shoddy governance in how the IPL has been run: with a lack of transparency, fragile checks and balances and, as some argue, a devil-may-care attitude. By extension, this is true of the BCCI. How can it not be, since the IPL administration is cut more or less from the same cloth.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA good starting point in putting better systems and processes in place would in recasting the Governing Council of the IPL, which now comprises entirely of BCCI administrators, one cricketer (Ravi Shastri) in an honorary capacity and a COO.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EMore professionalism and openness would add managerial heft as well as help alter negative perception.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhatever their credentials and effort, this motley lot has been proved ineffective in governance going by the number of controversies the league has faced. This has only succoured the perception that the IPL is being run by a cosy club.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMore professionalism and openness would add managerial heft as well as help alter negative perception. A couple of accomplished people drawn from beyond the cricketing universe can be of help. This is hardly unusual in the corporate sector, where people from the outside are nominated to the board of directors.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the 2014 season, Sunil Gavaskar who was put in charge by the Supreme Court to run the IPL, nominated technocrat Deepak Parekh (a cricket fanatic, too) as part of the Governing Council and the tournament went off without a hitch. Importantly, fans perceived this as closing the gap where transparency is concerned.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAdd an ombudsman, and the IPL would have a fairly robust structure in place. The world’s best run sports leagues (NBA in the US for instance) have such an entity in place only because when an enterprise gets big and cash rich, multiple issues will invariably crop up. For the public at large, how these are addressed are crucial.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI would also argue for a representative of the franchises on the Governing Council. After all, they cough up good money and must have their interests protected.

This is good for sycophancy, but hardly makes for efficiency.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe BCCI incidentally has also been heavily infiltrated by political parties (Congress, BJP, NCP, Shiv Sena et al) which queers the pitch further where straightforward administration is concerned. While staving off the pressures from such diverse interests can’t be easy, professional management would help.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA CEO for the BCCI would help centralize operations in somebody who knows such job, rather than somebody who essentially has to to keep state associations happy. The couple of \\u0026#8220;external\\u0026#8221; directors and an ombudsman, like one for the IPL, would give the management of the BCCI not only buffer against massive interference by vested interests from within, but also a richer flavour in administration.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EForming a Players Association (which would straddle both the BCCI and IPL) should be encouraged. While Indian cricketers are undoubtedly well looked after, as arguably the biggest stakeholders, they have no voice!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndian cricket is reportedly worth $2.5-3 billion. This success obviously redounds to the credit of people who have worked towards this over the past few decades, but now it needs more robust and professional management.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPerhaps the biggest elephant in the room is the issue of betting. As long as people and lawmakers in India pretend that betting is evil and should remain illegal, the monster will just remain below the surface and continue on its path of destruction.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELegalise betting and the monster is in the open, monitored and can be pegged.

In the course of filming a documentary on the topic of sterilization, we spoke to over 50 women in the state of Uttarakhand about the choices they made and why. Many, we found, preferred sterilization to other methods of contraceptives; they thought it was more reliable, less likely to cause infection, a common belief among women about copper Ts in this region.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EThe recent media attention given to this topic brings to light the suffering of many, and will hopefully provoke the reforms necessary to creating safer medical facilities for all Indians.

I don’t have much income, that’s why I got sterilized. When our income is limited what’s the use of having so many kids? ASHAs [Accredited Social Health Activist] came to visit me and told me about sterilization. When I got sterilized I went with my sister-in-law to the hospital and was given Rs600 in compensation. My husband and my mother-in-law were supportive. It took me about a month to recover fully. After a week I had to cook for my kids and take care of the house. I would have liked an entire month to recover, but we didn’t have anyone else to do the work. I chose this method because I had so many kids, and I didn’t know of other methods of contraception at that time. Now I’ve learned about more temporary methods. Copper T is not available here, you have to go to the cities, but you can get pills and condoms here.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBimla, 40, \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003ESediakhaal, Pauri District\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-299843\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  alignleft zoomable size-small\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"299843\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F299712%2Fthese-are-the-voices-you-did-not-hear-after-the-chhattisgarh-sterilization-tragedy%2Fi%2F299843%2F\\u0026text=These+are+the+voices+you+did+not+hear+after+the+Chhattisgarh+sterilization+tragedy\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F299712%2Fthese-are-the-voices-you-did-not-hear-after-the-chhattisgarh-sterilization-tragedy%2Fi%2F299843%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/bimla-is-in-purple-with-other-women-from-her-village-including-archana.jpg?w=1024\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/bimla-is-in-purple-with-other-women-from-her-village-including-archana.jpg?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Bimla is in purple, with other women from her village, including Archana.\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003EBimla is in purple, with other women from her village, including Archana.\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI was married when I was 18.

Sterilization wasn\\u0026#8217;t acceptable in my family. After three or four days I started having stomach aches so I had to tell them. My mother-in-law told me to get it undone but I told her I wouldn’t. Normally after a child is born the husband and wife stay separated for 11 days, and during this time my mother-in-law didn’t give me food. She wanted me to have another son because I only had one and they wanted two. I wrote a letter to my husband and told him they were not giving me food so he sent me Rs5,000 and told his mother to give me food.

It’s kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities – people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut today, our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFamilies who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s been this way for decades. And for decades, we haven’t done much about it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it’s been in nearly two years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate. It wasn’t perfect. It was a compromise, but it reflected common sense. It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents, while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHad the House of Representatives allowed that kind of a bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President – the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents before me – that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETonight, I am announcing those actions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFirst, we’ll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESecond, I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThird, we’ll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable – especially those who may be dangerous. That’s why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that’s why we’re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mother who’s working hard to provide for her kids. We’ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants – in every state, of every race and nationality – will still live here illegally. And let’s be honest – tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn’t realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isn’t being straight with you. It’s also not who we are as Americans. After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families. They worship at our churches. Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs my predecessor, President Bush, once put it: “They are a part of American life.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow here’s the thing: we expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. So we’re going to offer the following deal: If you’ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes – you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat’s what this deal is. Now let’s be clear about what it isn’t. This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive – only Congress can do that. All we’re saying is we’re not going to deport you.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. Well, it’s not. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today – millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat’s the real amnesty – leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What I’m describing is accountability – a commonsense, middle ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you’re a criminal, you’ll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe actions I’m taking are not only lawful, they’re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. And to those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill. I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile, don’t let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue. That’s not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn’t shut down our government again just because we disagree on this. Americans are tired of gridlock. What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose – a higher purpose.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMost Americans support the types of reforms I’ve talked about tonight. But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home. Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens. So we don’t like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. I know that some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they’ve gotten the raw end of the deal for over a decade. I hear these concerns. But that’s not what these steps would do. Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society. And I believe it’s important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other’s character.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBecause for all the back-and-forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. It’s about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAre we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAre we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents’ arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAre we a nation that educates the world’s best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs, businesses, and industries right here in America?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat’s what this debate is all about. We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration; we need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI know the politics of this issue are tough. But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it. Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs, without taking a dime from the government, and at risk at any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. I’ve seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn’t have the right papers. I’ve seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in a country they love. These people – our neighbors, our classmates, our friends – they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life. They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America’s success.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETomorrow, I’ll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva. Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on. When she started school, she didn’t speak any English. She caught up to the other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and became a good student. Her father worked in landscaping. Her mother cleaned other people’s homes. They wouldn’t let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school for fear the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant – so she applied behind their back and got in. Still, she mostly lived in the shadows – until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn’t travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported. It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAre we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid – or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EScripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger – we were strangers once, too.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMy fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal – that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat’s the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us. That’s the tradition we must uphold. That’s the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=300354\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/300354/barack-obamas-speech-on-immigration-reform-we-were-once-strangers-too/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-11-20T17:29:55-08:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=300354\",\"dc_creator\":\"Zachary M.

He also offered some facts about Lee as proof that he\\u0026#8217;s her brother.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis identity on Reddit hasn\\u0026#8217;t been verified, but the point rings true either way: This reporter\\u0026#8217;s quest for discovery, which is arguably what makes the show so addictive, is overshadowing the real tragedy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEven Rabia Chaudry, a lawyer and friend of Syed\\u0026#8217;s who originally brought the story to Koenig, is struggling with the show\\u0026#8217;s impact.

A spiritual and emotional low on many levels, and on many issues, including Adnan’s case. I knew at that point that Sarah was still investigating, I didn’t know how it was going or what the end story would look like. I felt tired of praying and tired of everything. For the first time in my heart I felt like there was little hope, and maybe nothing would ever change. Maybe Adnan would die in prison and maybe those who loved him would die without ever having him home.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPerhaps it\\u0026#8217;s inevitable that \\u003Cem\\u003ESerial\\u0026#8217;s \\u003C/em\\u003Elisteners take pleasure in joining their narrator in playing detective. But we should complement that enjoyment with an awareness of the story\\u0026#8217;s real-world significance: that criminal justice isn\\u0026#8217;t cut and dry, even in countries with strong rule of law. Witnesses change their stories, facts are hard to define, juries are biased.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe podcast\\u0026#8217;s long-form format gives both the reporter and her listeners the room to thoroughly delve into these larger problems—in a way that might actually help to influence policy. But to have that kind of impact, the show and its fans need to keep reality top of mind.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=299906\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/299906/reminder-serial-isnt-a-tv-show-its-real-life/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-11-20T10:39:19-08:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=299906\",\"dc_creator\":\"Sonali Kohli\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/crime.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Dallas Shootings\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/crime.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/299906/reminder-serial-isnt-a-tv-show-its-real-life/"], ["published_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 18:39:19 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Reminder: &#8220;Serial&#8221; isn&#8217;t a TV show, it&#8217;s real life"], ["updated_at", Fri, 21 Nov 2014 07:05:09 UTC +00:00]]
